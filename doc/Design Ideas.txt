  - Server rejects Agent Name if it is non-unique,
  - ELSE Server accepts Agent Name and permits access to other commands.
- Client requests Agent List
  - Server returns Agent List
- Client requests Session List
  - Server returns Session List
- Client requests to join Session
  - Server validates request for that Session.
  - Server registers the Agent for that Session.
  - Server provides Session ID.
- Client requests to create a Session
  - Server provides Session ID.

2) Session IO.  This is maintained only during the life of a Session.
