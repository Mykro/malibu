Design of Malibu

[Client]
  Model
    - for now, same as server
    - Eventually: cut down version of model suitable for the 
      client's consumption.  Some things may not be visible to the
      client - eg other players hands, bank, etc.

  Client Controller
  
  View
  

  ConsoleController (ClientController)
    - controls a ConsoleView
    - has 1 thread to manage user input and update display at each prompt
      
  GUIController (ClientController)
    - controls the GUI View
    - might have many threads to process kb/mouse input and repaint display

[Server]
  Model
    - encodes every single state in the game
      
  Controller
    - registers action handlers with client controllers
    - runs the game loop in 1 thread
    - publishes model updates to client controllers
    - receive actions from client controllers in action handlers
      and process them as part of the game loop

  View
    - no view
    - OR: view is simply the interface with clients, ie.
      "drawing view" is publishing the model to clients
